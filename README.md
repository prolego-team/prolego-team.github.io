These examples are based on publicly available data and OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.0 model.

Copy and paste these prompts directly into ChatGPT 4.0. You will get similar—not identical—results in the use cases we shared. Modify the prompts (a technique called prompt engineering) to get results more relevant for your business customers.
