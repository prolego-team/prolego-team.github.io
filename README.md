LLMs like OpenAI's GPT now allow financial institutions to automate back-office business processes that were previously challenging due to computers' inability to process unstructured data. 

However, it's difficult to answer what can be done with LLMs because business customers and technologists use different language. To address this, we created use case examples based on solutions deployed at large companies, generated using publicly available data and OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.0 model. Use these examples as conversation starters.

# Use cases and GPT prompts

Copy and paste these prompts directly into ChatGPT 4.0. You will get similar—not identical—results in the use cases we shared. Modify the prompts (a technique called prompt engineering) to get results more relevant for your business customers.
